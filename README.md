🌦️ Logistic Regression-Based Weather Forecasting Model
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to forecast weather conditions based on historical meteorological data. The primary goal is to predict whether it will rain or not, making it useful for basic forecasting, agriculture, and planning applications.

🔍 Overview
Weather forecasting is a complex task involving various climatic variables. In this project, we simplify the prediction problem to a binary classification task — Rain vs No Rain — using logistic regression, a fast and interpretable baseline machine learning model.
